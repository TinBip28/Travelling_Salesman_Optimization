Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem in Python 
===================
## Implemented techniques
* __Genetic Algorithm__
* __Simulated Annealing__
* __PSO: Particle Swarm Optimization__
* __Divide and conquer__
* __Dynamic Programming__
* __Greedy__
* __Brute Force__

When the solution is found it is plotted using Matplotlib and for some algorithms you can see the intermediate results
